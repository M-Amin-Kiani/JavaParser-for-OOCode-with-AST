            "1. **IOD (Overriding Method Deletion)**: This operator is suitable because the `Car` and `Bike` classes override the `move()` method from the `Vehicle` class. Deleting this overriding method will help test the behavior of the program when the overridden method is removed, ensuring that the correct method is called in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
            "2. **IOP (Overridden Method Calling Position Change)**: Changing the calling position of the overridden method is relevant because the `Car` and `Bike` classes override the `move()` method. This operator will help verify if the program behaves correctly when the overridden method is called at a different position in the class hierarchy.\n",
            "3. **ISI (Super Keyword Insertion)**: Inserting the `super` keyword is applicable in the `Car` and `Bike` constructors, where they call the superclass constructor using `super()`. This operator will test the initialization process and ensure that the superclass constructor is invoked correctly.\n",
            "4. **JSI (Static Modifier Insertion)**: The `vehicleCount` variable in the `Vehicle` class is a static member. Inserting the `static` modifier for this variable will help test the behavior related to static members and their accessibility.\n",
            "5. **JTD (this Keyword Deletion)**: In the `Car` and `Bike` constructors, the `this` keyword is used to call the superclass constructor. Deleting the `this` keyword will help test the constructor's behavior and ensure proper object initialization.\n",
            "6. **JID (Member Variable Initialization Deletion)**: The `brand`, `speed`, and `fuelCapacity` variables in the `Vehicle` class are initialized in the constructor. Removing their initialization will help test the default values and the behavior of the program when these variables are not explicitly initialized.\n",
            "\n",
            "These operators are chosen to specifically target the inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism aspects of the code, as well as some Java-specific features like static members and keyword usage. By applying these operators, you can effectively test the code's behavior and ensure that it adheres to the principles of object-oriented programming.\n",
